<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is Eric Akinkunmi, and I am a professional with a diverse background in both civil engineering and computer programming.
I graduated with a Master's degree in Civil Engineering and am a chartered Construction Manager. My journey into computer programming began out of curiosity and a strong desire to solve structural engineering problems that I encountered while working as a Civil Engineer.
</p>

<p>During my tenure as a Civil Engineer, I developed and implemented an automation tool for writing calculation notes, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy. This experience ignited my passion for programming and problem-solving.
Since then, I have ventured into various solution-based projects, including:
A resource management tool for optimising resources.
French and multiplication tables flashcards to aid learning and memorisation for pupils within 6-10 years age range.
</p>
<p>My main programming language of choice is Python, and I am currently developing my skills as a fullstack web developer. I enjoy creating tools and applications that solve real-world problems and enhance productivity.
I am continuously learning and expanding my expertise in both engineering and programming, aiming to bridge the gap between these fields and create innovative solutions that benefit various industries.</p>
